I'm not entirely sure why my Card constructor is not working.
I believe I have put in place all the things necessary, but whenever
I try to initialize the Deck and iterate through the creation of all
52 cards, I run into the issue where weird characters get put in. 
When I try to print the output during the initialization, everything
looks normal, but for some reason as soon as I try to DO anything with
the cards in the deck, they freak out and give me non-printable chars.

I started on this project late, Saturday afternoon instead of my usual
Wednesday, and I've been working on this issue for a solid 13 hours but
I can't figure out why I'm getting this problem.

I also didn't write my own shuffling algorithm because I wanted to make
sure that my code actually worked before I tackled the hard part. I am
familiar with making sorting algorithms, but doing the opposite has
posed quite a challenge for me.

My initial thought on approaching it would be to find the maximum
number of items to be randomized, and then take the unsigned time
signature and then do 
    int new_pos = time % #num_items
in order to get a rng seed that would always be unique. Then I would
take the first item in the list and swap it with the new_pos. Going
down the list this way would guarantee that each item is seemingly
randomized, although I am not sure about the time efficiency of this
method. This could definitely be improved by using the binary method
and running muliple sections in parallel.

Anyway, I'm upset that I can't finish the assignment in time, however
it is very late and I need sleep before class today.

Thanks for reading,
Ben
