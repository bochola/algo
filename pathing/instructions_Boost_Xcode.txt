Instructions for installing Boost Library within Xcode on a computer running the Mac Os

Step 1.
Download boost_1_57_0.tar.bz2 from Blackboard to your local directory in hard drive.

Step 2.
Open Terminal, go to the directory where you want to put the Boost installation, execute

tar --bzip2 -xf /path/to/boost_1_57_0.tar.bz2

then boost_1_57_0 is created in this directory and its absolute path is, for example, /path/to/boost_1_57_0

Step 3.
Open Xcode and create a new project

Step 4.
Select the project
Click on Build Settings
Go to Search Paths section
Add /path/to/boost_1_57_0 to Header Search Paths

Step 5.
Configuration completes. You could run a simple test as shown below:

Note: the following program reads a sequence of integers from standard input, uses Boost.Lambda to multiply each number by three, and writes them to standard output:

#include <boost/lambda/lambda.hpp>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <algorithm>

int main()
{
    using namespace boost::lambda;
    typedef std::istream_iterator<int> in;

    std::for_each(
        in(std::cin), in(), std::cout << (_1 * 3) << " " );
}

Copy the text of this program above into main.cpp in your project, then build and run.
